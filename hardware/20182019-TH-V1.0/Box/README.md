This files are the .STL objects for a box and a stand designed to accomodate the detpic board.
The stand is a simplistic, earlier version of the box.
The box first version is designed without taking in consideration a large pic on top.
First version is not tested yet.

# Update: 19/07/2019

Organization of different objects through folders:

## BoxFull
- Box.stl: Main box with updated height for detpic and USB hole.
- Cover.stl: Box cover with slide system.

## BoxSlim
- Box.stl: The same as BoxFull/Box.stl but with several holes through the walls in order to save printing material.
- Cover.stl: The same as BoxFull/Cover.stl but with several holes through the walls in order to save printing material.

### Note: Not 3d Printed or tested yet.
